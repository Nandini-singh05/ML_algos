# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and can be used independently for different tasks.


Each algorithm is implemented in its respective folder, along with the complete source code and the dataset used. Feel free to utilize the code in your own projects, experiments, and learning endeavors.

Let's learn together :)

Happy machine learning!
